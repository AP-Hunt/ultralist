Ultralist is a task management system for technical people. It includes a command-line component that is very fast and stays out of the way. There is also a beautiful webapp that seamlessly syncs with the command-line.

Ultralist is based off of the [Getting Things Done](gtd) system. It has a concept of due dates, projects, and contexts.
